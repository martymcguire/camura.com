  <p>In 2005, when feature phones ruled the earth and iPhones didn't exist, Camura
  began as a way to post photos to a shared stream of pictures.</p>
  <p>13 years later, it is increasingly rare that anyone visits the
  site to browse the archive, much less post a new photo or leave a comment.</p>
  <p>In 2015, we turned off public browsing for Camura, so that only existing
  users could view photos, comments, profiles, and other content.</p>
  <p>The last real attempt to update the site was in 2013, when we had to patch
  some bugs in the Ruby on Rails 2 framework that runs it, and migrate to a
  new hosting provider. Features were disappearing before that time, as
  services we relied on changed their offerings or went offline.</p>
  <p>These days, a Rails 2 app running on the open web feels like a liability.
  We don't want to leak any of your personal data, should a breach occur, and we
  don't have the time or resources to update a website with almost no active use.</p>
  <p>Thanks to everyone who played a part in the Camura community over the years!</p>
  <p>Your photos and comment data are backed up securely. They are not lost!</p>
