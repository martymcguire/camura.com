  <p>In 2005, when feature phones ruled the earth and iPhones didn't exist, Camura
  began as a way to post photos to a shared stream of pictures.</p>
  <p>13 years later, all but the extremely infrequent user shows up to revisit the
  site's archive, post a new photo, or leave a comment.</p>
  <p>In 2015, we turned off public browsing for Camura, so that only existing
  users could view photos, comments, profiles, and other content.</p>
  <p>The last real attempt to update the site was to patch some bugs in the Ruby
  on Rails 2.X framework that we use to run the site. Even then, features were
  disappearing as services we relied on changed their offerings or went offline.</p>
  <p>At this point, a Rails 2 app running on the open web is a liability. We don't
  want to leak any of your personal data, should a breach occur, and we don't have
  the time or resources to update a website that so few people are using.</p>
  <p>Your photos and comment data are backed up securely, so that they won't be lost.</p>
